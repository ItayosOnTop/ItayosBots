# ItayosBot - Advanced Minecraft Bot System Specification

## Overview
ItayosBot is a sophisticated Minecraft bot system built using Mineflayer. It enables automation of various Minecraft tasks through multiple cooperative bots that can be controlled via Discord and in-game chat commands.

- **Task specialization**: Dedicated miner, builder, and protector bot types
- **Dual command interface**: Control through both Discord and Minecraft chat
- **Owner authentication**: Commands only accepted from authorized users
- **Resource gathering**: Automated mining of specific blocks and items
- **Construction**: Building structures from schematic files
- **Combat & Protection**: Defending players and other bots from threats
- **Crafting & Inventory Management**: Automated crafting and item storage
