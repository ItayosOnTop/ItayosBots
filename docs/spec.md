# Minecraft Bot System Specification

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an autonomous Minecraft bot system using Mineflayer, with Discord integration for remote monitoring and control. The system will support resource gathering, building from schematics, security functions, and multi-bot coordination.

## System Architecture

### Core Components
- **Bot Framework**: Built on Mineflayer for Minecraft interaction
- **Command System**: Processes in-game and Discord commands
- **Resource Management**: Handles gathering, storage, and utilization
- **Building System**: Processes schematics and constructs structures
- **Security Module**: Provides protection against threats
- **Multi-Bot Coordinator**: Orchestrates multiple bots working together
- **Discord Integration**: Enables remote monitoring and control

### Technology Stack
- Node.js
- Mineflayer (Minecraft bot library)
- Discord.js (Discord API integration)
- Custom pathfinding and decision-making algorithms

## Functional Requirements

- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor and report on resource collection

### Phase 5: Schematic Processing
- **Schematic Parsing**: Read and interpret schematic files
- **Material Requirements**: Generate lists of needed materials
- **Construction Algorithm**: Efficient block placement planning
- **Validation System**: Verify correct structure building
- **Progress Monitoring**: Track and report building progress
- **Error Correction**: Identify and fix building mistakes

### Phase 6: Multi-Bot Coordination
- **Communication Protocol**: Bot-to-bot information sharing
- **Role Assignment**: Specialized tasks for different bots
- **Task Distribution**: Efficient allocation of work
- **Shared Knowledge**: Centralized information accessible to all bots
- **Collision Avoidance**: Prevent bots from interfering with each other
- **Priority System**: Handle task importance and interruptions

### Phase 7: Security System
- **Threat Detection**: Identify hostile mobs and players
- **Combat Tactics**: Strategies for different enemy types
- **Perimeter Security**: Monitor and secure defined areas
- **Alert System**: Notify about security threats
- **Defense Formations**: Coordinated multi-bot defense
- **Retreat Logic**: Strategic withdrawal when overwhelmed

### Phase 8: Advanced Features
- **Optimized Building**: High-efficiency construction algorithms
- **Adaptive Resource Gathering**: Adjust to available resources
- **Advanced Pathfinding**: Navigate complex terrain
- **Failure Recovery**: Automatic recovery from errors
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track and optimize bot performance
- **State Persistence**: Maintain bot state between sessions
- **Visual Reporting**: Share screenshots via Discord

### Phase 9: Testing and Polish
- **Test Scenarios**: Comprehensive testing in various situations
- **Stress Testing**: Performance under load with multiple bots
- **Optimization**: Memory and CPU usage improvements
- **Bug Fixing**: Resolve identified issues
- **Documentation**: Code documentation and API reference
- **User Guide**: Instructions for command usage

### Phase 10: Deployment
